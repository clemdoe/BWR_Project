# 1D Boiling

## Description

This test case portrays the two-phase capabilities of GeN-Foam. It consists
of a 1D channel with a pressure-driven flow of liquid sodium. A power source 
is turned on at time 0 and eventually leads to boiling, with flow excursion 
(as the flow is pressure driven). After a certain time elapses (see 
constant/phaseProperties.structureProperties.powerOffCriterionModel), the power
is turned off.
